# Analytics CLI Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through setting up Google Search Console, Google Analytics 4 (GA4), and BigQuery access for the Analytics CLI.

## üìã Prerequisites

### Required
- **Google Search Console Property**: Your website must be verified in Google Search Console
- **GA4 Property**: Your website must have Google Analytics 4 set up and tracking page visits
- **Google Cloud Platform Account**: With billing enabled (required for BigQuery)
- **Administrative Access**: To GSC property, GA4 property, and Google Cloud Platform

### Optional
- **BigQuery Project**: Not required initially - we'll create one during setup
- **BigQuery API**: Will be enabled during the setup process

## üéØ Google Search Console Setup Verification

First, verify that your website is properly set up in Google Search Console:

1. **Check GSC Dashboard**: Go to your Google Search Console property dashboard
2. **Verify Site Ownership**: Ensure your site is verified and you have access
3. **Check Data Availability**: Look for search performance data in the last 90 days
4. **Confirm API Access**: Ensure you can access the Search Console API

### GSC Property Types

The CLI works with different GSC property types:
- **Domain Properties**: `https://example.com/` (recommended for full domain coverage)
- **URL Prefix Properties**: `https://www.example.com/` (specific protocol/subdomain)

> **Note**: Use the exact URL format as shown in your GSC property settings.

## üéØ GA4 Setup Verification

First, verify that your GA4 is properly tracking:

1. **Check GA4 Dashboard**: Go to your GA4 property dashboard
2. **Verify Real-time Data**: Look for recent page views in the last 24 hours
3. **Confirm Tracking**: Ensure you see data in Reports > Realtime

### GA4 Tracking Methods

The CLI works with GA4 regardless of how tracking is implemented:

#### ‚úÖ With Google Tag Manager (GTM)
- **Most Common**: If you're using GTM, you're all set
- **No Additional Setup**: The CLI will work with your existing GTM implementation
- **Data Source**: Uses the same GA4 data that GTM sends

#### ‚úÖ Without GTM (Direct Implementation)
- **Direct GA4 Code**: If you have GA4 code directly on your website
- **No Additional Setup**: The CLI works with direct implementations too
- **Data Source**: Uses the same GA4 data from your direct implementation

> **Note**: The CLI doesn't care how GA4 tracking is implemented - it only needs access to the GA4 Data API, which works the same regardless of implementation method.

## üîß Google Cloud Platform Setup

### Step 1: Access Google Cloud Console

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Sign in with your Google account

2. Click "Admin" > "Data Export"
3. Click "Link to BigQuery"
4. Select your project and dataset
5. Choose export frequency (daily recommended)
6. Click "Submit"

> **Note**: This step is optional. The CLI can work with GA4 Data API alone, but BigQuery provides more historical data and advanced querying capabilities.

## ‚öôÔ∏è CLI Configuration

### Step 1: Create Environment File

```bash
cp env.example .env
```

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Edit your `.env` file with the following values:

```bash
# Google Search Console Configuration
GSC_SITE_URL=https://example.com/  # Your GSC property URL (exact format from GSC)
GSC_CREDENTIALS_FILE=./secrets/gsc-sa.json  # Path to your service account JSON

# GA4 Configuration
GA4_PROPERTY_ID=123456789  # Your GA4 property ID
GA4_CREDENTIALS_FILE=./secrets/ga4-sa.json  # Path to your service account JSON

# BigQuery Configuration (if using BigQuery)
BQ_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id  # Your Google Cloud project ID
BQ_DATASET=analytics_123456789  # Your BigQuery dataset name
BQ_LOCATION=US  # Your BigQuery location

# Alternative: Use single service account for all
# GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=./secrets/gcp-sa.json
```

### Step 3: Store Service Account Credentials

```bash
# Create secrets directory
mkdir -p secrets

# Move your downloaded JSON file here
mv ~/Downloads/your-service-account-key.json ./secrets/ga4-sa.json
```

### Step 4: Update Configuration File

Edit `config.js` if needed:

```javascript
export default {
  sources: {
    searchconsole: {
      enabled: true,
      siteUrl: process.env.GSC_SITE_URL || "https://example.com/",
      credentialsFile: process.env.GSC_CREDENTIALS_FILE || "./secrets/gsc-sa.json",
      // ... rest of config
    },
    ga4: {
      enabled: true,
      propertyId: process.env.GA4_PROPERTY_ID || "123456789",
      credentialsFile: process.env.GA4_CREDENTIALS_FILE || "./secrets/ga4-sa.json",
      // ... rest of config
    },
    bigquery: {
      enabled: true,  // Set to false if not using BigQuery
      projectId: process.env.BQ_PROJECT_ID || "your-project-id",
      dataset: process.env.BQ_DATASET || "analytics_123456789",
      // ... rest of config
    },
  },
  // ... rest of config
};
```

## üß™ Testing with Sample Data

### Option 1: Use GA4 Sample Dataset (Recommended for Testing)

Google provides a free sample dataset that you can use to test the CLI without setting up your own GA4 property:

**Sample Dataset Details:**
- **Source**: Google Merchandise Store (e-commerce site)
- **Data Period**: November 1, 2020 - January 31, 2021
- **Location**: BigQuery Public Datasets
- **Dataset ID**: `ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce`

**Setup for Testing:**

1. **Create a Google Cloud Project** (if you don't have one)
2. **Enable BigQuery API** in your project
3. **Access the Sample Dataset**:
   - Go to [BigQuery Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery)
   - In Explorer, click "Add Data" > "Public Datasets"
   - Search for "GA4" and add the `ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce` dataset

**Configure CLI for Testing:**

```bash
# Option 1: Use the test configuration file
cp env.test .env
# Then update BQ_PROJECT_ID with your actual project ID

# Option 2: Manually update your .env file
GA4_PROPERTY_ID=123456789  # Use any placeholder - won't be used for BigQuery
BQ_PROJECT_ID=your-test-project-id
BQ_DATASET=ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce  # Use the sample dataset
BQ_LOCATION=US
```

**Test with Sample Data:**

```bash
# Test the setup
npm run test:setup

# Run the CLI and try BigQuery presets
npm start
# Select: BigQuery > Preset > "BigQuery Events Sample"
```

### Option 2: Use Your Own GA4 Property

If you have a GA4 property with data:

```bash
# Use your actual GA4 property ID
GA4_PROPERTY_ID=your-actual-property-id
GA4_CREDENTIALS_FILE=./secrets/ga4-sa.json
BQ_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
BQ_DATASET=your-dataset-name
```

## ‚úÖ Verification

### Test Your Setup

```bash
# Test configuration
npm run test:setup
```

You should see:
- ‚úÖ Configuration loaded successfully
- ‚úÖ Enabled sources: ga4, bigquery
- ‚úÖ Environment variables detected

### Run the CLI

```bash
npm start
```

You should see the interactive menu without errors.
